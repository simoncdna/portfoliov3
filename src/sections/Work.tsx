/**
 * Work — la côte. One plate at a time, and the plate is the chrome form itself.
 *
 * The section is a tall band with a sticky screen: the form sits in the middle,
 * with its name under it and 01–04 under that, the neighbouring projects showing at the
 * edges of the screen. Scrolling
 * advances the plate: the metal is rolled out into a 16:9 sheet and takes that
 * project's photograph, and each change throws the sheet out of the frame to come back
 * carrying the next one (see workPlate and formPhoto); the name decodes itself as it
 * changes (see ScrambleText).
 *
 * The band is read in three parts.
 *
 *  1. SETTING UP — the blob arrives in the middle, then the name fades in and the numbers
 *     appear WHILE the metal flattens into the first project's picture. The forming is not
 *     queued after the type; they are one beat, which is why that beat is owned by the
 *     entrance timeline rather than by the plate handler (see the `forms` gate).
 *  2. THE PLATES — four equal stretches of scroll, one per project.
 *  3. PUTTING AWAY — the same sequence backwards: the type fades, and the metal is
 *     released back to a blob before the piece leaves the middle.
 *
 * All three are scrubbed, not played on arrival: every transition on this page is
 * reversible, and the entrance in particular has to happen while the screen is
 * already STUCK — before it sticks, the DOM furniture is still sliding up the page
 * while the form (drawn by a fixed canvas) is not, so anything visible then is
 * misaligned by however far the band still has to travel.
 *
 * Two things are worth knowing before changing anything here.
 *
 * The piece is not in this DOM. It is drawn by the fixed chrome stage, at the
 * viewport's centre, so this section cannot contain it — only arrange furniture
 * around it. Hence the frame sized off --form-dim rather than the viewport, and
 * hence the form's own lift above centre (DOCK_Y_WORK): what has to look centred is
 * the whole group, so the piece must sit above the middle by half the height of the
 * text below it, and only the WebGL side can move it.
 *
 * The scroll is the single source of truth for the selection. Clicking a number
 * SCROLLS to that plate rather than setting the index — a click that sets state
 * directly is undone by the very next scroll event, which is the classic trap of
 * this kind of double control.
 */

/**
 * The shares of the band's travel given to the setting-up and to the putting-away.
 * Against the 480vh band (380vh of travel) that is ~68vh for the entrance and ~84vh
 * for the exit, leaving ~57vh per plate. Each is used twice — to size its timeline and
 * to bound the plate selection — so the two halves cannot disagree about where the
 * section proper starts and ends.
 *
 * Both sequences live INSIDE the band, which is the point: the screen is stuck for
 * the whole of the band, so the furniture is centred on the form throughout, and the
 * putting-away is finished before Contact arrives. The exit used to run from the
 * band's end onwards, i.e. over Contact's first screen — the piece was still being
 * put away while the next section was reading, and the whole four-beat sequence had

 * shown plate does not jump to wherever the scroll is — it walks there, one plate at
 * a time, never faster than this. The pause is a pause in the SELECTION only: the
 * clock keeps running underneath, so the sheet is still swaying and the metal still
 * flowing all the way through it (see formClock — nothing here touches the form's own
 * animation).
